			It's always difficult to do a physical exercise without drawing. Especially when there are multiple variables. 
			I remember myself struggling with my pencil trying to make a worthy drawing. 
			That's why I decided to help those who are in the same situation. 

			This website will simulate a mass spring system or a pendulum system.
